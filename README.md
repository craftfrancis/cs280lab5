The intent of this system is to be a tool that can be used to gather information on the status of a specific or several specified repositories.

# How to Get the System
1. Create an empty directory to hold our files, or settle to place them in an existing directory if you wish.
2. Use the command git init in order to initialize this directory as a git directory. This will allow you to clone our directory in the next step.
3. Clone our repository by using this command: git clone https://github.com/craftfrancis/gitStati/
You should now have full access to the entirety of this project's code
