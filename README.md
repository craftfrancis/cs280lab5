The intent of this system is to be a tool that can be used to gather information on the status of a specific or several specified repositories.

# Tutorial

1. Download the .zip file of the repository and extract the files to whatever directory you see fit. (At the
very least, you need gitStati.java and StreamGobbler.java.)
2. Open your terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the .java files. (If you are unclear
on how to do this, using the cd command, please see this fine documentation for more information.)
3. First, you need to compile the main program file, gitStati.java. To do this, type the following
command into the terminal: javac gitStati.java. (So long as StreamGobbler.java is in the same
directory, you should receive no errors doing this.)
4. Once this is done, you can run the program by typing the command java gitStati into the terminal.
5. Thankfully, the program is rather self-explanatory with its prompts, so you should be fine following its
own instructions once youâ€™re running it!
