# Requirements Document

The product we have been solicited to create is 'gitStati'.
This product will be a tool that will traverse directories, starting from a specified root directory, and evaluate the statuses of all nested git repositories.
To reach this goal, our group has specified three levels of goals. The first level, or Prime Directives, will be the few most important pieces. These are the "mission critical" objectives, the requirements rather than the suggestions, and they are guaranteed to be released with the system. From there the next two levels will have their features released upon completetion; the release style will be incremental.

## Prime Directive

These aspects of the program are less features, and more the center of the program. The program will not be released until these are finished, allowing the program to be used in its more bare bones form. Listed in no particular order, the Prime Directive requirments are

    - Ability to traverse a tree of directories from a specified 
      root directory
    - Ability to determine if the current position is a git 
      repository and if it has any directories in it
    - Ability to retrieve information from all git repositories 
      found
    
## Second Level

These are the extended features of the program that we feel will best increase efficiency and ease of use. They will be realeased individually upon creation, allowing the program to have an incremental style release. While not requirements for the system to work, they are considered the most important goals- as well as the most reasonably attainable- besides the critical goals. In no particular order, second level requirements are

    - Output to terminal
    - Color coordinated output
    - summary statistics
    
## Third Level

The third level requirements are features we feel would allow for the excellence of the program. As with second level requirments, they will be released upon completetion. In no particular order, they are

    - Tracking of Garbage Files
    - Ability to Return to Most Recent Menu Rather Than Top Menu-
      suggested through issue system
